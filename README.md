# Brewwz

Brewwz is a fake e-store who sells beers. 

The goal of this project is to practice web developpement and use latest stacks like React (Vite package), Redux, React Router DOM and Chakra UI to design it. 

I try to use best practices for each of the library i use on this project. Feel free to create a new branch and MR if i made a mistake or if you want to use a better practice. 

# How to use it ? 

  Please use develop branch !

First you can clone it on your local environement then run `npm install` on root directory to add every dependencies. Like a Vite project, you can run it with `npm run dev` and, by default, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5173` on your favorite browser. 

Enjoy !
